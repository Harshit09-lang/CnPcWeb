          Catalyst was launched in 2016 by IIT Mandi as Himachal Pradesh’s
            first Technology Business Incubator (TBI). Strongly backed by the
            Central Government and State Government, Catalyst strives to
            incubate technology-based start-ups focused on economic and/or
            social impacts. As the name implies, it serves as a 'catalyst' to
            nurture and guide entrepreneurial initiatives with social and/or

          BioX Centre

          <div className="sub-content">
          The majority of the research in the BioX area is being carried out as a part of the BioX Centre, which was conceived at IIT Mandi in 2012, driven by the need for affordable health care for India, and advanced technology interventions in agriculture and for preservation of the environment in the Himalayan Region. Since then, IIT Mandi started to hire faculty and made an initial investment of Rs. 10 crores in lab equipment. As it had reached a critical mass, the formal structure of the BioX Centre was approved in December 2016. The BioX Centre building was inaugurated on May 13, 2017, by Professor K. Vijay Raghavan, Secretary, Dept. of Biotechnology, Govt. of India in the presence of Professor Sarit Kumar Das, Director IIT Ropar, and Professor Timothy A Gonsalves, Director IIT Mandi.
